## Interpretation of Results

Based on the most recent trading day in the dataset, Amazon (AMZN) closed highest at $3,507.07.
The monthly-resampled line chart shows that while all ten tickers generally trend upward over time, Tesla and NVIDIA exhibit the steepest late-cycle rallies.
When ranking total percentage gains (from each ticker‚Äôs first available close to its most recent):

**Top 3**
Tesla (TSLA) at 23919.3%
NVIDIA (NVDA)
Amazon (AMZN): 2519.2%


These results suggest that over the long term EV innovators and high-growth hardware have outperformed many software and platform names in sheer raw returns.
